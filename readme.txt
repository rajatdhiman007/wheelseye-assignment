The given assignment has been completed on time, there is just one issue left to be resolved that is, when we click on the delete button, the row we want to delete gets deleted but if we again want to delete some row then it is not removed. This issue can be resolved easily by looking into the code deeply but due to the lack of time, this issue could not be resolved. Another issue was that I didn't understand what is the AJAX requirement as in where to redirect the form data in that is in JSON format so I have written the code for converting data to JSON and send the response using AJAX in a dsend.js file. 
Rest of the UI is completely ready as required. There are 5 files main.html, jsfile.js, dsend.js,logo.png, and cssFile.css. I hope you like my work. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
